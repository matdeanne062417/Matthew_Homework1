Variables
  are container for storing data values. like a dictionary for JAVASCRIPT
  it consist of:
  
  -keyword(var, let, const)
  -space (spacebar)
  -identifiers (words to be used to)
  -an equal sign
  -value of the identifier (giving meaning to the identifier. never start with a number, always with a letter and always put "" sign or '')
  -; (never forget to type this!)
  
  For example: var name="matthew";
  
Strings
  String is/are the word(s) you put inside the "" of a variable. it is a reference on a variable

Function (Arguments, return)
 Set of statements either perform a task or calculate and return a value
    return - it is a way to show the result of a calculation
    Arguments - is the one we put in the parenthesis of a Function; Function myFunction (argument) {}

if Statements
  allows us to build a program that can make decisions based on certain conditions

Boolean Values (true, false)
  usually used in if statements to evaluate certain scenarios or conditions if it is a yes(true) or a no(false)
